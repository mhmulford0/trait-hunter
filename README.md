# ts-node-starter

The `ts-node-starter` scaffolding project is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) which makes it easy for you to start a new Node.js project with TypeScript.

Using this template, you can build **standalone apps**, **libraries** and/or **CLI tools**. The `ts-node-starter` setup is configurable and comes with a lot of features included.
